# Catching Cards

## Intro
First and foremost, I wanted to learn Phoenix and Elixir, so this is my best attempt to do that.

But on top of that I really wanted this product. Sooo with that said...

Catching Cards is a tool to build a digital rolodex. When going to a business conference you're going to meet dozens of people and get a number of business cards. This tool is so you may organize them, mark where you met them, and gives you a personal comment section to remind yourself of about them later.

But what would this be without that new fangled AI? So to make life easier, the end goal of this project is to also allow you to upload a photo of the business card to a local Ollama (with OpenAI API on the maybe eventually docket) to have it parse out the name and contact info of the person on the card! 


## How to run locally
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
